The NLLP Talks series brings together researchers from academia and industry working at the intersection of law and NLP. The talks explore in depth recent research in this multidisciplinary space. By featuring presenters and discussants from complementary disciplines, the NLLP Talks series aims to further bridge law and computational linguistics.

The talks are scheduled every month on Fridays at 8am PST/11am EST/16 UK/17 CET time.

Please follow announcements of upcoming talks on Twitter or our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/nllp/shared_invite/zt-qrjzyncj-5Rq4AXnMKQVLkwWSQknRHw)

Please reach out to the [organizers](mailto:nllp.chairs@gmail.com) if you wish to present in this series.
