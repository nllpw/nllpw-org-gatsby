## John Armour (Oxford Law)

**Title**: Access to Caselaw Data in the UK: Constraints and Future Prospects

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider the legal, regulatory and practical constraints on access to caselaw data in the UK for use in legal NLP applications, contrasting these with the position in other leading jurisdictions. We will analyse how the legal constraints can be managed and provide an overview of the future prospects for data access.

He has held visiting posts at various institutions including the University of Auckland, the University of Chicago, Columbia Law School, the University of Frankfurt, the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Private Law in Hamburg, the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the University of Sydney. He is a member of the American Law Institute and an Academic Member of the Chancery Bar Association. Armour has published widely in the fields of company law, financial regulation, and corporate insolvency. His main research interest lies in the integration of legal and economic analysis, with particular emphasis on the impact on the real economy of changes in company law, corporate insolvency law and financial regulation. He serves as an Executive Editor of the Journal of Corporate Law Studies and the Journal of Law, Finance and Accounting, and has been involved in policy-related projects commissioned by the UK’s Department of Trade and Industry (now BEIS), Financial Services Authority (now FCA) and Insolvency Service, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the World Bank.

## Sylvie Delacroix (Birmingham Law & Alan Turing Institute)

**Title**: Data Trusts as a Bottom-up Empowerment Tool

**Abstract**: This presentation will focus on data trusts as a bottom-up empowerment tool. It will proceed from an analysis of the particular type of vulnerability concomitant with our 'leaking' data on a daily basis, to argue that data ownership is both unlikely and inadequate as an answer to the problems at stake. 
There are three key problems that bottom-up data trusts seek to address:

- Lack of mechanisms to empower groups, not just individuals
- We can (and should) do better than 'make belief' consent.
- We can (and should) do better when it comes to intelligent data sharing.

**Bio**: Sylvie Delacroix focuses on the intersection between law and ethics, with a particular interest in Data and Machine Ethics, Agency and the role of habit within moral decisions (Habitual Ethics?,  Bloomsbury / Hart Publishing, 2021). Her current research focuses on the design of computer systems meant for morally-loaded contexts. She is also considering the potential inherent in ['bottom-up' Data Trusts](https://doi.org/10.1093/idpl/ipz014) as a mechanism to address power imbalances between data-subjects and data-controllers. Professor Delacroix’s work has notably been funded by the Wellcome Trust, the NHS and the Leverhulme Trust, from whom she received the Leverhulme Prize. Professor Delacroix was one of three appointed commissioners on the Public Policy Commission on the use of algorithms in the justice system (Law Society of England and Wales), which released its report on 04 June 2019. She is a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute and a Mozilla Fellow. Visit the [Data Trusts](https://datatrusts.uk/) website - a new site co-created by Sylvie that brings together information about data trusts, with the aim of helping advance debate about their use.
