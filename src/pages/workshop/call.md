  - NLP systems for legal professionals such as E-Discovery, contract review, risk assessment.
  - Open or proprietary NLP tools for citizens, lawyers, courts, or regulators
- Interdisciplinary position papers on topics including, but not limited to:
  - Legal or socio-legal analyses relating to the role NLP in the legal domain
  - Ethical, legal and regulatory aspects of data collection and LLM use in the legal domain
  - Critical reflections about the benefits and challenges with using NLP technologies in the legal domain
  - The role of NLP in Access to Justice and Digital Legal Empowerment
  - The role of NLP in platform governance and content moderation including legal, regulatory and ethical aspects of automated moderation, accountability under emerging platform regulations (e.g., DSA, DMA, AI Act) and impacts on freedom of expression and access to justice
  - Legal and ethical challenges of NLP in the context of copyright and IP

## Submission

We accept papers reporting original (unpublished) research of two types:
- [Long papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#long-papers) (max 8 pages + references)
- [Short papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#short-papers) (max 4 pages + references)

Appendices, references, optional [limitations](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#limitations) section, optional ethics section and acknowledgements do not count against the maximum page limit and should be formatted according to the guidelines below. 

To submit a paper, please access the submission link (TBA).

Conference proceedings will be published on the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/).

### Ethics section

The NLLP workshop adheres to the same standards regarding ethics as the EMNLP 2025 conference [here](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#ethics-policy). Authors will be allowed extra space after the 8th page (4th for short papers) for an optional broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. Note that an ethical considerations section is not required, but papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks that do not discuss these issues will not be accepted.

### Non-archival option

The authors have the option of submitting previously unpublished research as non-archival, meaning that only the abstract will be published in the conference proceedings. We expect these submissions to describe the same quality of work as archival submissions. These will be reviewed following the same procedure as archival submissions. This option accommodates publication of the work or a superset at a later date in a conference or journal which does not allow previously archived work and to encourage presentation and feedback on mature, yet unpublished work. Non-archival submissions should adhere to the same formatting and length constraints as archival submissions.

### Dual Submission and Pre-print Policy

Papers that are under consideration at other workshops, conferences or journals during the review period must explicitly indicate so at submission time. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at the NLLP 2025 workshop must notify the organizers by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be published or withdrawn.

There is no anonymity period or limitation on posting or discussing non-anonymous preprints while the work is under peer review. However, if the preliminary version of a paper was posted on arXiv, the paper should *not* have a self-reference to it in the submission.

### ACL Rolling Review Submissions

Our workshop also welcomes submissions from ACL Rolling Review (ARR). Authors of any papers that are submitted to ARR and have their meta review ready may submit their papers and reviews for consideration for the workshop until 2 September 2025. This should include submissions to ARR for the May deadline. The decision of publication will be announced by 7 October 2025. The commitment should be done via the workshop submission website (TBA) ("ACL Rolling Review Commitment" submission type)

### EMNLP 2025 Submissions

Authors of any papers that have been reviewed for EMNLP 2025 and were rejected have the opportunity to send their paper and reviews to be considered for publication in the NLLP workshop proceedings as long as the topics are relevant to those described in this call for papers.

The deadline for submitting papers and reviews is 2 September 2025. The decision of publication will be announced by 7 October 2025. The submission should be done via the workshop submission website (TBA) ("EMNLP 2025 Submission with reviews" submission type)

### Double-Blind reviewing

The review process is double-blind and should follow the ARR guidelines on ensuring two-way anonymized review available [here](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#instructions-for-two-way-anonymized-review). Papers that violate these requirements will be desk rejected.

### Submission Style & Format Guidelines

Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) (Latex and Word). Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to “*ACL” conferences available [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html). Authors may not modify these style files or use templates designed for other conferences.

Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.
